Website for wedding photos

## UI
Uses a grid layout.
Uses iframes to show images, and navigates through the images with the help of arrow buttons.
Has another iframe to show images in the folder.

## Backend
Currently, the backened is me manually sharing the image and copying its id into the displayable id url.

## Future
1. Real backend that can fetch all the images in the google drive folder and navigate through them without needing individual photo ids.
2. Security to make sure user cannot find the ids through console.
